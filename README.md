These code reimplement in C++ the algorithm described in the paper _A Functional Description of TeX's Formula Layout_. The original SML implementation can be found at [ftp://ftp.cs.uni-sb.de/formulae](ftp://ftp.cs.uni-sb.de/formulae).

Make sure that the working directory is `fonts` when running the executable.
